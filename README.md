### Part 3
1. I think it is a feature that can be tested, but the testing would be limited as the feature requires moving parts where it sends from one user to another user. This feature will be difficult to conform towards unit testing as it can be part of a large moving application. The parts you can try to unit test is whether the message was sent to the right destination or whether the message was sent correctly.
2. Yes, I can easily use unit testing on max message length becuase we can test whether our program does something when it exceeds a specific number of characters. For example we can have a test where it tries to input a text more than 80 characters. Then we can check whether the counter is counting the correct number of characters or that a text's color has changed to red when it's exceeded.
